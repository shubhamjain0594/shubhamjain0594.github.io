<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>Researchers from CMU, MIT and Union College identified two characteristics required for creating a good team</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as &ldquo;equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking&rdquo;. On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. &ldquo;As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well&rdquo;, Woolley said. &ldquo;But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The good teams all had high &ldquo;average social sensitivity&rdquo; — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people’s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling — an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley’s experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team A is composed of people who are all exceptionally smart and successful. When you watch a video of this group working, you see professionals who wait until a topic arises in which they are expert, and then they speak at length, explaining what the group ought to do. When someone makes a side comment, the speaker stops, reminds everyone of the agenda and pushes the meeting back on track. This team is efficient. There is no idle chitchat or long debates. The meeting ends as scheduled and disbands so everyone can get back to their desks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team B is evenly divided between successful executives and middle managers with few professional accomplishments. Teammates jump in and out of discussions. People interject and complete one another’s thoughts. When a team member abruptly changes the topic, the rest of the group follows him off the agenda. At the end of the meeting, the meeting doesn’t actually end: Everyone sits around to gossip and talk about their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based &ldquo;conversationaly equality&rdquo; and &ldquo;social sensitivity&rdquo;, Team B is expected to perform better than Team A.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Google started Project Aristotle to study how perfect teams work and how can we create perfect teams. Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a &ldquo;work face&rdquo; when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel &ldquo;psychologically safe&rdquo;, we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor.</p>
