    <p>Deconvolutions were introduced in 2014 in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038">&ldquo;Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation&rdquo;</a> and has been extensively used in Semantic Segmentation and Generative Adversarial Networks. But its saturated now and the problems involved with it including checkerboard effects play a huge role in the error it produces. <a href="http://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/">This</a> blog post goes down the journey of deconvolutions and problems associated with it. It also suggests some solutions and how it can be replaced by better alternatives such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05158">subpixel-cnn</a>. If you are doing segmentation or working with generative networks, its time to move away from deconv.</p>
