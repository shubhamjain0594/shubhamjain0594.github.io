I am Shubham Jain, working as a Deep Learning Scientist at [Qure.ai](http://qure.ai). I graduated in Computer Science from [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2016. This blog is to record and share my learnings, some good blog posts I come across and my experiences. I like reading, traveling and watching sports. You can get in touch with me through [twitter](https://twitter.com/shubhamjain0594) or [github](https://github.com/shubhamjain0594).
