## Starters

[This](http://yyue.blogspot.in/2015/01/a-brief-overview-of-deep-learning.html) blog post by [Ilya Sutskever](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ilya/), also a research director at OpenAI is one of the must read posts for any one diving into deep learning for practical applications. It gives you an insight into why it works, some things you must keep in mind for practical purposes and if you love it, you can just dive into comments section for some cool conversation between [Bengio](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/index.html) and Ilya.
