Music seems pleasure but sometimes also a distraction. At such points I play some good random videos in background. These help me in gaining new knowledge but at the same time does not distract me from work. I have compiled a small list of such videos in deep learning that I have heard so far and loved them. Will go on adding more.</description></item><item><title>Hugo Larochelle TEDx</title><link>https://shubhamjain0594.github.io/post/hugo-larochelle-ted/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2016 18:13:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shubhamjain0594.github.io/post/hugo-larochelle-ted/</guid><description>This TED talk takes you through the journey of Deep Learning in last ten years and its amazing to see how it has evolved from a time when neural nets were not trusted and there were just a few countable people working, to today when there are so many people that you can find 4 research groups working on a similar idea at the end of the day. Pretty insightful and interesting and in a way it shows how a new technology comes into play and we should keep looking for small kicks, they maybe the thing of the future.</description></item></channel></rss>
