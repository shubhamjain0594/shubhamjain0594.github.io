      <description>2017 was a year of firsts and changes for me. I published my first research paper, my first international conference invitation as a speaker, organizing a meetup on AI in Mumbai which grew to a 2000+ strong community, my first road trip and leaving my first job. As the year came to an end, there were a lot of changes, my daily life went through. I shifted from my parent&amp;rsquo;s house to my own rental flat, my (paternal) grandfather and (maternal) grandmother passed away in an interval of a month, leaving just 4 people at home from 6 at one point of time, my sister moved to the US, my view of life changed from chasing goals to enjoying journies and also the way I look at relationships.</description>
