      <description>This TED talk takes you through the journey of Deep Learning in last ten years and its amazing to see how it has evolved from a time when neural nets were not trusted and there were just a few countable people working, to today when there are so many people that you can find 4 research groups working on a similar idea at the end of the day. Pretty insightful and interesting and in a way it shows how a new technology comes into play and we should keep looking for small kicks, they maybe the thing of the future.</description>
