      <description>Last week of April 2017, I was attending Re-work Deep Learning Summit in Singapore. I was representing Qure.ai and speaking about some of the work we have been doing in this field. The conference had speakers from Google Deepmind, Baidu Silicon Valley AI Lab, Facebook; startups such as Kata.ai, SmartCow.ai; investor firms such as Zeroth.ai, etc. In this post, I will introduce to you about all the impressive ideas I learned about in the conference.</description>
