      <description>2017 was a year of firsts and changes for me. I published my first research paper, my first international conference invitation as a speaker, organizing a meetup on AI in Mumbai which grew to a 2000+ strong community, my first road trip and leaving my first job. As the year came to an end, there were a lot of changes, my daily life went through. I shifted from my parent&amp;rsquo;s house to my own rental flat, my (paternal) grandfather and (maternal) grandmother passed away in an interval of a month, leaving just 4 people at home from 6 at one point of time, my sister moved to the US, my view of life changed from chasing goals to enjoying journies and also the way I look at relationships.</description>

      <description>This is a letter, I wrote in my senior year to one of the juniors describing my first year and what I learned from it.
These are my views. I want you to comment and us to discuss, it would enrich both of us. You know most of the things about my freshie year. So I won’t go into things which you already know. Fill it with your memory.
When I came into IIT, I was a completely ignorant child with just one thing in mind that IITians God hote hai.</description>

      <title>Growing up - A journey of life</title>

      <description>Last 2 years have been the turning points of my life. I rewind back this time and here I am, a happy-go-lucky guy, laughing all time, playing around and no seriousness at any moment of time. Most of us are like this at this time I suppose. I am 20 now, sitting in Korea, here for an internship with Samsung electronics, and in this period, I have lost things very valuable to me but gained a lot of experience at the same time.</description>

      <description>Yo Junta, this is Shubham Jain a student at IIT Bombay. Being an IITian, I always encounter someone who wants some advice, guidance on how to go for JEE, is he capable and all. So I thought why not just write down my experience and share with world. I know there are already many blogs on this and my blog isn’t any different apart from fact its my personal experience which for me is very different than others.</description>
