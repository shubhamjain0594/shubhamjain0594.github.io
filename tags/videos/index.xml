      <description>I like to hear things in my background while I am working. Music seems pleasure but sometimes also a distraction. At such points I play some good random videos in background. These help me in gaining new knowledge but at the same time does not distract me from work. I have compiled a small list of such videos in deep learning that I have heard so far and loved them.</description>
