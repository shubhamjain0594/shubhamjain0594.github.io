      <description>Deep learning and Neural Networks have some really cool applications (ideas), and here are a few I have come across and are really tangential to mainstream applications.
Defeating Image Obfuscation with Deep Learning This paper from Cornell and University of Texas at Austin uses DL to reconstruct the images which are pixelated, blurred or encrypted using privacy-preserving photo (P3) algorithm. These techniques are many times used to hide the identities in some sensitive videos and photos in various media.</description>
