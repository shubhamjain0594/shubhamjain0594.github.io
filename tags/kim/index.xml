      <description>This are some points to keep in mind (KiM), from the article on How to write a first-class paper published as nature article.
 Keep your message clear  The most important information should be in the main text. To avoid distraction, writers should put additional data in the supplementary material. Writers should put their results into a global context to demonstrate what makes those results significant or original. In the conclusion, include a one- or two-sentence statement on the research you plan to do in the future and on what else needs to be explored.</description>
